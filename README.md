# 🚗 Self-Parking AI Simulator - README

## 📌 Project Overview

Build a self-parking simulation system using Python, Streamlit and matplotlib/pygame/p5/if time permitted, even CARLA (or other simulation environments), which can:

* Accept user inputs (car size, parking space info) -Streamlit(if time permitted import car types with a drop down option with data import)
* Recommend a parking strategy (forward, reverse, or no fit)
* Plan a trajectory using traditional or learned methods
* Control the vehicle to complete the maneuver
* Optionally visualize the process

## 🧠 Modules Breakdown

### 1. Car Strategy Recommender (MLP Classifier)

**Input Features:**

* Car length, width
* Parking spot length, width
* Angle or distance to spot

**Output Classes:**

* `0` = Reverse Parallel
* `1` = Forward Perpendicular
* `2` = Cannot Park

**Model Structure:**

```python
nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(5, 32),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(32, 16),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(16, 3)
)
```

### 2. Trajectory Planner

* Use Bezier curves or Hybrid A\* to generate a smooth parking path
* Optionally use learned planning (e.g., imitation learning)

### 3. Controller

* Basic PID control (speed, steering)
* Advanced: Use reinforcement learning (DQN, PPO)

### 4. Simulation

* Use CARLA to:

  * Load parking scenes
  * Control vehicles
  * Simulate sensor data
